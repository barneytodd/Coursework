## Task Description
### Managing Memory and Time in Future Cryptography: the Shortest Vector Problem

#### Background

Many real-world applications require significant computational resources to run at scale. As
a result, it is very important to be able to manage the memory requirements and run-time at
implementation time to ensure the applications can be efficiently and effectively deployed.
In this assignment, we are dealing with The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP). It represents a
challenging computational task with far-reaching implications in the domains of lattice-based
cryptography and computational mathematics. Within cryptography, SVP can serve as the
foundation for secure lattice-based cryptographic systems and post-quantum cryptography.
Beyond cryptography, SVP is utilised in error-correcting codes, network design, signal
processing, and combinatorial optimisation problems. Its relevance extends to quantum
computing, coding theory, integer programming, and diverse mathematical and
computational domains, underpinning a wide range of real-world applications and
cryptographic security.
The core objective of SVP is to find the shortest nonzero vector within a given lattice, where
a lattice is a discrete set of points in *n*-dimensional space formed by linear combinations of a
set of basis vectors. In mathematical terms, SVP seeks to determine a vector within the
lattice such that its Euclidean norm (length) is minimised.

#### Problem Definition

The Shortest Vector Problem is the most famous and widely studied computational problem
on lattices. A Lattice is a discrete and periodic grid-like structure formed by linear
combinations of a set of basis vectors in �-dimensional Euclidean space.
The key characteristic of a lattice is that it extends infinitely in all directions. In the context of
computational mathematics and computer science, lattice problems often refer to tasks
related to these lattice structures. Common lattice problems include finding short vectors
within a lattice, which is the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP).
The SVP problem that you need to solve through your implementation as part of this
assignment is as defined as follows:
Given a lattice structure *L* embedded in *n*-dimensional Euclidean space ℝ<sup>*n*</sup> , where is � �
generated by a set of linearly independent basis vectors {� , the objective is to 1
, �2
, ..., ��
}
identify a nonzero lattice vector � ∈ � such that the Euclidean norm (� ) of is minimised. In

�
short:
Find � ∈ �, � ≠ 0, such that ||�||₂ is minimised,
where ||�||₂ is the Euclidean norm of vector �, defined as: ||�||₂ = , where
1
�
∑(�ᵢ)² �ᵢ
represents the components of vector � in the �-dimensional space.
Your goal is to implement a solution to this problem at an arbitrary number of dimensions �
with considerations for runtime and memory requirements.
