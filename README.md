## Task Description
### Managing Memory and Time in Future Cryptography: the Shortest Vector Problem

#### Background

Many real-world applications require significant computational resources to run at scale. As
a result, it is very important to be able to manage the memory requirements and run-time at
implementation time to ensure the applications can be efficiently and effectively deployed.
In this assignment, we are dealing with The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP). It represents a
challenging computational task with far-reaching implications in the domains of lattice-based
cryptography and computational mathematics. Within cryptography, SVP can serve as the
foundation for secure lattice-based cryptographic systems and post-quantum cryptography.
Beyond cryptography, SVP is utilised in error-correcting codes, network design, signal
processing, and combinatorial optimisation problems. Its relevance extends to quantum
computing, coding theory, integer programming, and diverse mathematical and
computational domains, underpinning a wide range of real-world applications and
cryptographic security.
The core objective of SVP is to find the shortest nonzero vector within a given lattice, where
a lattice is a discrete set of points in ï¿½-dimensional space formed by linear combinations of a
set of basis vectors. In mathematical terms, SVP seeks to determine a vector within the
lattice such that its Euclidean norm (length) is minimised.
